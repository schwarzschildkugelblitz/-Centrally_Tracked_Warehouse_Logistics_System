ArUco marker detection program, 
This program corrects distorted perspective of a rectangular plane
with ArUco markers at its corners. 
It can detect and output any valid ArUco marker in the selected dictionary

The aruco module is based on the ArUco library, a popular library for detection of 
square fiducial markers developed by Rafael Mu√±oz and Sergio Garrido

Dependencies:
    pip install opencv-contrib-python
    pip install numpy
    pip install scikit-image
